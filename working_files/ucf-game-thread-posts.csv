The next play being a 14 yard run by Brooks just out an exclamation point on the incomplete pass.,15

So when Xavier White drops a wide open 1st down and Tech turns it over it‚Äôs on ZK but when Tech scores he gets none of the credit?

6:36 PM,Chrome21,The offensive staff has to have changed made this off-season. This is embarrassing. A former mid major going toe to toe with TTU at home. This has been going on decades. The McGuire era must be intolerant to shitty playcalling that costs us games.   We're going to pull this off huge pick there by CJ but the defense isn't and hasn't been the problem.
